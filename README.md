<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>

This repository holds a recipe webpage made entirely with html. It has a main page which holds links to all the recipe pages. And recipes for making different dishes with their ingredient list and the steps needed to make the dish.

The project will help me practice the following html elements:
    <ol>
        <li>`<h1>`: is a header element. It contains page titles or header texts. It ranges from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.</li>
        <li>`<p>`: is a paragraph element. It holds long texts or paragraphs.</li>
        <li>`<a>`: is an anchor element. This element is used for holding relative or absolute links.</li>
        <li>`<img>`: is an image element. This is an element for storing images also could be relative or absolute links.</li>
        <li>`<ul>`: is an unordered element. It is used to make unordered lists using dots or other bulletpoints.</li>
        <li>`<ol>`: is an ordered elment. This elements is used for ordered lists using numbers, alphabets, etc...</li>
        <li>`<li>`: is an list item element. It is a child element of `<ul>` and `<ol>`. It is used to make the lists.</li>
