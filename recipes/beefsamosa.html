        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Beef Samosa</strong> is a popular savory snack made of a crispy, golden-brown pastry shell filled with a flavorful mixture of spiced ground beef, onions, peas, and various seasonings. Often served as an appetizer or street food, 
            it is deep-fried to a crunchy perfection and enjoyed with dipping sauces like chutney or yogurt. The combination of rich spices and tender beef makes it a delightful treat in many cultures, particularly in South Asia, the
             Middle East, and parts of Africa.</p>
