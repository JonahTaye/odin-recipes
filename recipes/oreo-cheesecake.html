    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Oreo cheesecake</strong> is a decadent dessert that combines the rich, creamy texture of traditional
        cheesecake with the beloved crunch of Oreo cookies. The base is often made by blending crushed
        Oreos with butter, creating a perfect crust that complements the smooth filling. The cheesecake
        itself is made with cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, creating a dense yet velvety texture.
        Topped with crushed Oreos and a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, Oreo cheesecake is a
        crowd-pleaser that brings together the best of both worlds—cheesecake and cookies. Whether served as
        individual slices or in a larger, shared form, it's a dessert that's both indulgent and satisfying,
        making it a favorite for parties, gatherings, or a special treat.</p>
