        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Oreo cheesecake</strong> is a decadent dessert that combines the rich, creamy texture of traditional 
            cheesecake with the beloved crunch of Oreo cookies. The base is often made by blending crushed 
            Oreos with butter, creating a perfect crust that complements the smooth filling. The cheesecake
             itself is made with cream cheese, sugar, and eggs, creating a dense yet velvety texture.
            Topped with crushed Oreos and a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, Oreo cheesecake is a 
            crowd-pleaser that brings together the best of both worldsâ€”cheesecake and cookies. Whether served as 
            individual slices or in a larger, shared form, it's a dessert that's both indulgent and satisfying, 
            making it a favorite for parties, gatherings, or a special treat.</p>
