            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Mac and Cheese</strong> is a deliciously creamy dish made by combining cooked pasta with a
                rich, velvety cheese sauce. The sauce typically includes butter, milk, and a variety of cheeses, with
                cheddar being the most common for its sharp and tangy flavor. It's a quick and easy dish that provides
                ultimate
                comfort with every bite.
                Whether served as a simple stovetop version or baked for a crispy golden top, mac and cheese is a
                versatile dish that can be customized with extras like bacon, herbs, or even spices for an extra
                kick. It's a favorite in many households and can be enjoyed as a hearty main or as a satisfying side
                dish for a variety of meals.</p>

                <li>1 pound dried elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1½ pounds medium cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>5 cups whole milk or half-and-half, or a combination</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish
                    with
                    butter.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add 1 pound dried elbow macaroni and cook for 2
                    minutes
                    less than package directions for al dente. Meanwhile, grate 1 1/2 pounds medium cheddar cheese on
                    the large
                    holes of a box grater (about 6 cups). Reserve 1 cup of the cheese for sprinkling.</li>
                <li>Drain the macaroni. Melt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter in the now-empty pot over medium heat.
                    Sprinkle in
                    1/4 cup all-purpose flour, and stir until it turns golden and begins to smell toasted, 1 to 1 1/2
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Slowly whisk in 5 cups whole milk or half-and-half, 1/2 cup at a time, until no lumps of flour
                    remain. Bring
                    to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, whisking frequently, until the sauce
                    is
                    thickened and clings to the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. You may need to adjust the heat to low
                    to
                    prevent the milk from boiling over.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Add the remaining 5 cups cheese, 1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1/4
                    teaspoon
                    black pepper, and stir until the cheese is melted. Add the macaroni and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Transfer half of the macaroni and cheese to the baking dish and spread into an even layer. Sprinkle
                    with
                    half of the reserved cheese. Repeat layering the remaining macaroni and cheese and shredded cheese.
                    Sprinkle
                    paprika over the top if desired.</li>
                <li>Bake until the mac and cheese is bubbling around the edges and the cheese on top is melted and
                    golden brown
                    in spots, about 10 minutes.</li>
